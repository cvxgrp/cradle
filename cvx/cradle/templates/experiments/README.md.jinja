Simple Notebook repo without heavy ci/cd.

Good choice for experiments without the ambition to move the
resulting software further down to pypi, etc. A more complete
setup is provided in the blueprints for packages.

## The Makefile

Please start the day with

```bash
make
```

If you prefer working on a clean sheet do

```bash
make clean
```

## The virtual environment

Please use

```bash
make install
```

to build a virtual environment containing all dependencies declared in your
`requirements.txt` file. This will run a simple pip install.


## Marimo

We use Marimo (instead of Jupyter) to perform our experiments. Start with

```bash
make marimo
```

For smaller projects we recommend the installing jupyter route and work locally.
