## About this repo

We have a [workflow](.github/workflows/latex.yml) compiling the LaTeX document(s)
in [paper](paper). For that step we are using [tectonic](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic).
The resulting pdf documents are released to the [draft branch]({{ repository }}/tree/draft) of the repo.

## :warning: Private repositories

Using workflows in private repos will eat into your monthly GitHub bill.
You may want to restrict the workflow to operate only when merging on the main branch
while operating on a different branch or deactivate the flow.
